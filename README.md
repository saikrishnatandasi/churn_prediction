## 📊 Key SQL Queries

### Customer Churn Analysis
```sql
-- Churn rate by contract type
SELECT 
    contract_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_customers,
    SUM(churn) as churned_customers,
    ROUND(SUM(churn) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as churn_rate_percent
FROM customers
GROUP BY contract_type
ORDER BY churn_rate_percent DESC;
```

### Revenue Impact Assessment
```sql
-- Monthly revenue loss due to churn
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN churn = 1 THEN monthly_charges ELSE 0 END) as monthly_revenue_loss,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN churn = 1 THEN 1 END) as churned_customers,
    AVG(CASE WHEN churn = 1 THEN monthly_charges END) as avg_revenue_per_churned_customer
FROM customers;
```

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### Model Performance Comparison

| Model | AUC Score | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Random Forest | 0.87 | 0.82 | 0.79 | 0.80 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.84 | 0.78 | 0.75 | 0.76 |

### Feature Importance (Top 5)
1. **Contract Type** (0.24) - Month-to-month vs Annual
2. **Tenure Months** (0.19) - Customer lifetime
3. **Monthly Charges** (0.16) - Pricing sensitivity
